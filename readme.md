localenv grabs the latest versions of php and nginx and drops some better default configurations into each of the two.

## Requirements
* Windows
* git bash with unix tools

## Installation
* Using git bash, run *setup.sh*

## Usage
Start the server
* localenv.bat start

Stop the server
* localenv.bat stop

## Why?
* I got tired of the traditional wamp stack
* I don't like the bloat you get with XAMPP and WAMP
* I want a PHP stack I can install to many locations with isolated configurations.
